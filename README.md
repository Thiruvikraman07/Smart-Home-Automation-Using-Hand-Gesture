# Smart-Home-Automation-Using-Hand-Gesture
Introduction:

 Smart Home Automation using Hand Gesture is an innovative system that aims to enhance the user experience and convenience in controlling various devices and appliances within a smart home environment. Traditional methods of controlling smart homes, such as mobile applications or voice commands, often require physical interaction or verbal communication. However, these methods may not always be practical or accessible in certain situations, such as when the user's hands are occupied or when voice commands are not feasible due to noise or privacy concerns. 
In this proposed system, hand gestures are utilized as an alternative means of controlling smart home devices. The system employs computer vision techniques to interpret and recognize specific hand gestures made by the user. By analyzing the captured video feed from a camera or a dedicated gesture recognition sensor, the system can accurately identify and interpret the user's hand movements.


The recognized hand gestures are then mapped to predefined commands or actions associated with different smart home devices and functionalities. This enables users to control a wide range of devices, including lights, thermostats, security systems, entertainment systems, and more, simply by using intuitive hand gestures. The system provides a seamless and hands-free experience, eliminating the need for physical interaction or voice commands.

The proposed smart home automation system offers several advantages, including increased accessibility, convenience, and user-friendliness. Users can effortlessly control their smart homes without the need for additional devices or complex setups. Moreover, the system can be easily integrated with existing smart home platforms and technologies, allowing for a seamless integration into the user's current setup.

In conclusion, the Smart Home Automation using Hand Gesture system presents an innovative and efficient approach to control and manage smart home devices. By leveraging computer vision and gesture recognition technologies, the system offers users a hands-free and intuitive method of interacting with their smart home environment, enhancing convenience and improving the overall user experience.

Working:
Camera: The system utilizes the camera to capture the hand gestures made by the user. The camera captures real-time video footage of the user's hand movements.
Gesture Recognition: Computer vision algorithms are applied to the video frames captured by the camera. These algorithms extract relevant features from the images, such as hand shape, movement, and position.
Gesture Classification: We use media pipe and OpenCV to detect the hand position and by finding the landmarks of the hand position we will be able to map different hand gestures.
Firebase Integration: The recognized hand gesture data is sent from the laptop to the Firebase platform. Firebase provides a cloud-based real-time database that enables data storage and synchronization between multiple devices.
Raspberry Pi Integration: The Raspberry Pi, a small single-board computer, is connected to the Firebase database. It acts as a bridge between the laptop and the smart home devices.
Light Brightness Control: The Raspberry Pi retrieves the hand gesture data from the Firebase database. Based on the recognized gesture, it sends appropriate commands to the smart home lighting system to increase or decrease the brightness.
Smart Home Lighting System: The smart home lighting system receives the commands from the Raspberry Pi and adjusts the brightness of the lights accordingly.
By integrating the laptop camera, Firebase, and Raspberry Pi, the system enables the user to control the brightness of the smart home lights using hand gestures. The laptop camera captures the gestures, which are recognized and classified using OpenCV and Mediapipe. The recognized gestures are then sent to the Raspberry Pi through Firebase. Finally, the Raspberry Pi communicates with the smart home lighting system to adjust the brightness level based on the recognized gestures.
This system provides a convenient and hands-free control mechanism for the smart home lighting, allowing users to adjust the brightness level by simply making hand gestures in front of the laptop camera.
